# Campus Navigator & Event Hub: Project Summary

ðŸš€ Campus Navigator & Event Hub
Campus Navigator & Event Hub is a mobile app designed to revolutionize how students explore and engage with their university environment. It offers intuitive, location-aware navigation paired with real-time alerts for nearby events, club activities, and campus hotspots.
Using turn-by-turn navigation, students can easily locate classrooms, labs, and facilities, while staying informed about ongoing and upcoming events around them.
The app is built using an open-source stack:
React Native, MongoDB, and OpenStreetMap, ensuring a powerful yet manageable development workflow. It integrates with university calendars and club databases to provide accurate, up-to-date event info.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
Moving personalized avatars on the map,
Indoor/outdoor positioning,
Augmented Reality for enhanced navigation,
Real-time event discovery and notifications.

To validate the concept, we built a working prototype, enabling rapid testing and iteration of key features like map navigation and event modals.

The app aims to:
Boost student engagement
Simplify campus wayfinding
Improve access to campus events
Strengthen community through increased awareness
With low development costs and high impact, this solution brings smart, connected navigation to modern university life
