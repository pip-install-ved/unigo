# Campus Navigator & Event Hub: Project Summary

The Campus Navigator & Event Hub is a mobile application that transforms how students navigate and engage with their university environment. The project creates an intuitive, location-aware companion for campus life.

The application helps students find their way to classrooms, labs, and campus facilities through turn-by-turn navigation while simultaneously alerting them to nearby events, club activities, and points of interest. As students move through campus, the app provides real-time notifications about ongoing and upcoming events in their vicinity.

Built on a streamlined open-source technology stack including React Native, MongoDB, and OpenStreetMap, the project balances sophisticated features with manageable development complexity. The application integrates with university calendar systems and club event databases to ensure all campus activities are accurately represented and discoverable.

Key features include personalized avatars that move along the map, indoor/outdoor positioning, augmented reality elements for enhanced navigation, and a comprehensive events discovery system. The project addresses common campus challenges like finding classrooms in unfamiliar buildings, discovering relevant extracurricular activities, and making efficient use of campus resources.

The Campus Navigator aims to increase student engagement, reduce time wasted on wayfinding, improve accessibility, and strengthen the campus community through better awareness of activities and locations. With moderate development costs and significant potential impact on student experience, the project represents a valuable addition to modern university digital infrastructure.
